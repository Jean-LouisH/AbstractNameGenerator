# AbstractNameGenerator

*In progress*

This is a script to take a syllable count from the user, generate a permutation list of abstract syllables and allow the user to choose how and which will be presented to them.

The names can be used as is, or work as a pronunciation starting point for other names. This works well for naming characters, objects and environments if meaning is not of concern.
